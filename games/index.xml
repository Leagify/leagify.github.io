It runs based off of data generated by the NFL Draft.
&amp;ldquo;Coaches&amp;rdquo; pick schools, which have athletes. Those athletes are drafted in the NFL draft. Those draft picks correspond to a value chart created by Leagify. Bonus points are provided for picks that are the result of a trade, which adds a little variance to the game. The highest scoring coach at the end of the NFL Draft is the winner.</description></item></channel></rss>
