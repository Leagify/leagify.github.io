It runs based off of data generated by the NFL Draft.
&amp;ldquo;Coaches&amp;rdquo; pick schools, which have athletes. Those athletes are drafted in the NFL draft. Those draft picks correspond to a value chart created by Leagify. Bonus points are provided for picks that are the result of a trade, which adds a little variance to the game. The highest scoring coach at the end of the NFL Draft is the winner.</description></item><item><title>Intro To Draft Charts</title><link>https://leagify.github.io/charts/intro-to-draft-charts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 15:57:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://leagify.github.io/charts/intro-to-draft-charts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the draft charts section!
